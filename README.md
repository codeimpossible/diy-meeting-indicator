# Getting Started

## Parts list

- [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3708) _I bought the one with headers pre-soldered because I suck at soldering, but if you're comfortable with solder you can likely save some ðŸ’µ here_.
- [Mini-HDMI Adapter](https://www.canakit.com/mini-hdmi-adapter.html)
- [2.5A Power Adapter](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-adapter-power-supply-2-5a.html)

- [Raspberry Pi Zero Case](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3446)
- Something to mount the case on the wall, I used these [3M Command Tabs](https://www.amazon.com/Picture-Hanging-Decorate-Damage-Free-17206-6ES/dp/B07ZPXS64N/ref=asc_df_B07ZPXS64N) but they might be a bit OTT.
