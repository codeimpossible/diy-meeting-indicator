## Installing the Client

The client is pretty easy to install, however it only supports OSX currently. Download the `clients` directory and store it somewhere on your machine. Then run the command below.

```
$ ./client install <<PI_IP>>
```

Replace `<<PI_IP>>` with the IP Address of the raspberry pi server.
